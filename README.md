# Comparative-Analysis-of-Various-Regression-Models-on-Laptop-Price-Prediction
A machine Science project on Comparative Analysis of Various Regression Models on Laptop Price Prediction

This project compares four regression models - Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest - for predicting laptop prices based on various features. The evaluation is based on four metrics, and the goal is to identify the most suitable model for accurate predictions. The results can provide valuable insights for businesses and consumers, aiding informed decisions on pricing and purchasing strategies.

# Laptop Price Prediction Model

Description: Developed a machine learning model to predict laptop prices based on their specifications and features.

# Data Preprocessing:
